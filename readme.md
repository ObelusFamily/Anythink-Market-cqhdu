# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## Steps to install
1) First: clone the repository to your machine
git clone https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-cqhdu.git

2) After that make sure to cd into the folder Anythink-Market-cqhdu.
3) To run the next steps, make sure to have docker and docker compose installed.
4) Start the services by doing docker-compose up    
5) Right now the services should be running. You can check this by going to localhost:3001 and verify that you are seeing a webpage.
